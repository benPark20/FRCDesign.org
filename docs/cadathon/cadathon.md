# Cadathon

This page introduces the Frcdesign.org Cadathon format, as well as act as an archive for previous Cadathons. The goal is to create a reproducable format which allows for an easy reproduction of Cadathons year to year. Many elements are inspired by the F4 Cadathon (with permission!), though we'll put our own spin on some aspects.

# Dates:

July 14th - July 21st

August 4th - August 11th

## Format

1. The Cadathon lasts 1 week long. 
2. Teams may group up in a maximum of 3 people (Students/Mentors/Alum are allowed to compete), in which prize money is split between the members. If an FRC team chooses to compete, there is no limit on how many members may participate on that team, but they must all be on the same FRC team. 
3. Submissions must be native Onshape, and the document plus all sub documents must be public at the start of the cadathon, with the the final version being created the due date. There will be a 3 hour grace period for last minute changes after the final "due" time that you may request, but the initial submission must be sent beforehand. (Please do not be doing CAD at 3 am anyway)
4. In the spirit of coopertition, all teams will have their own thread to work in and submit in the discord server. Please post public CAD links to all subdocuments + Main documents in the thread, and do your communications there. We've found that the ability to collaborate, share ideas across teams, and get help increases the quality of CAD. We found that this does not lead to a loss of competitiveness, and helps engage in the learning process.
5. A final technical binder and strategy document is required at the time of submission. Renders will not increase your score, but you may render if you feel that it would make your presentation better.
6. Good CAD practices are heavily weighed in this Cadathon. 

## Rules:
I'm allowed to copy paste the rules.. right? (credit to f4)

R11 A Team must submit their ROBOT for Inspection. The ROBOT must be an electromechanical assembly designed by the CADathon Team to perform specific tasks when competing. The ROBOT should include all of the basic systems required to be an active participant in the game â€“ power, communications, control, BUMPERS, and movement. The ROBOT implementation must obviously follow a design approach intended to play this game (e.g. a box of unassembled parts placed on the FIELD, or a ROBOT designed to play a different game does not satisfy this definition). R11 requires that this ROBOT has been purpose-designed for this game.

R12 All ROBOTS will go through a brief formal inspection by a GDC member. The inspection will go on during the judging process. If a team is breaking a rule it will be taken into consideration during judging and cause a 5 point penalty per broken rule. 

R13 Although we cannot truly govern budget constraints we ask teams to use the honor system and follow the budget rules imposed by FRC for 2024. This can be found in the 2024 Game Manual.

R14 Mechanical/electrical designs created before Kickoff are only permitted if the source files are from COTS part providers. If the part is designed by you, the part needs to be publically available or placed in the #pre-cad-release channel on our Discord server before the Cadathon.

R15 Teams are required to CAD a single set of BUMPERS up to external specifications. This can be in any color or texture you like as long as it is PG. Adding a way to actually mount the BUMPERS is a good way to earn points with the JUDGES in terms of model detail. The BUMPERS will also objectively always be made of FRC regulation fabrics. 	

R16: Sections 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, and 9.9 of the FIRST Rapid React manual must be followed as they reasonably pertain to the CADathon, except as modified in this manual, The manual can be found [here](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2022/Manual/2022FRCGameManual.pdf)


## How to Submit

1. Fill out the submission form at the Cadathon Page you are competiting in.
2. Fill out the submission template in the #cadathon-Submissions forum with the main assembly image, links to the sub documents, and technical documents. This helps us organize all the submissions for public viewing, though the form is still required.
